My husband is an Italian, speaks Italian, English, French and Spanish. 
We have 2 beautiful boys.

I have lived most of my life in Tokyo, then one day I decided to move to Rome.
After almost 10 years in Rome, we decided to move to Sicily that we fell in love at first sight.

I believe in what Goethe saying. ""You have to come here, to Sicily, in order to understand Italy.""

Our villa is held with love and Japanese precision, decorated with an authentic Italian, specially Sicilian style. The historic name of the villa is SALINARA.

Just 500 meters from mediterranean sea with many islands close to. We are living small city named Marsala, famous for beautiful sea, archeology, foods and especially wine. I am a sommelier too.

We really enjoy to meet new guests and share some pieces of Sicilian slow life.  More than 15 years experiences and curiosity for Sicily make your vacation much more interesting.

We have a passion for sailing, traveling, organic gardening, living more sustainably with wonderful nature of Sicily.

Thank you for reading our profile and hope to see you soon in Sicily!

La nostra storia

""Giovanni Allibrio e sua moglie Marina continueranno a coltivare in maniche di camicia cactacee e succulente in grandi esemplari. I loro vivai del Valentino dispongono di oltre 10.000 metri quadrati di serre fredde, ma √® molta di pi√π la terra in cui, ordinatamente in fila, crescono all‚Äôaperto vistosi esemplari.Qualche decennio fa il padre di Giovanni acquist√≤ questi terreni sassosi e ben esposti a due passi dal mare, lo stesso mare che fa da sfondo e d√† atmosfera agli sceneggiati del commissario Montalbano. Al tempo dell‚Äôacquisto c‚Äôerano solo isole di macchia mediterranea, radi carrubi centenari, qualche fico d‚ÄôIndia, capperi, una masseria ottocentesca abbandonata. Poi Giovanni, completati gli studi di perito agrario, ha impiantato coltivazioni di ortaggi e un giorno, a fargli cambiare direzione, √® arrivato Guglielmo Betto. Originario di Scicli e trasferitosi a Roma, questo AVVOCATO che ha dato molto alla divulgazione e alla passione in Italia per le piante esotiche all‚Äôinizio degli anni Novanta fece visita al vivaio durante una rimpatriata in Sicilia. Betto sugger√¨ le prime piante da seminare, insegn√≤ i suoi trucchi di esperto, segu√¨ con affetto i primi successi.

A trent'anni dall‚Äôesordio Giovanni e Marina continuano a investire sulla professionalit√†, sulla voglia di fare e di imparare, sul desiderio di mantenere vivo il territorio che amano. Adesso che i tre figli sono grandi, nel loro progetto di vita e lavoro hanno aggiunto le mostre di giardinaggio in giro per l‚ÄôItalia, aule e programmi come fattoria didattica (la seconda nata in Sicilia) e un delizioso agriturismo, che hanno chiamato Dimore del Valentino, in una parte non usata della masseria, con migliaia di grandi succulente in coltivazione attorno"".

Hello! Nice to meet you!
After spending 14 years living and traveling around the world, I decided to return to Sicily in 2013. Since then I manage some beautiful properties by the sea, a B&B at the beach where I also teach Yoga, a kitesurf and surf centre and a small surf shop! 
I believe it is vital to live in harmony with the nature and the rhythm of the sea, so I practice all the water sports that I can, depending on the conditions of the winds and of the waves: kitesurf, surf, windsurf and SUP Yoga! 
I love to travel and every year, when the tourist season is Sicily is over, I travel for 4 months and from host I become an Airbnb guest!
Besides from the sea, which is my greatest passion, I love to cook (vegetarian and vegan!), I practice (and teach) yoga, skate and I love to read books on Oriental Philosophies (Lao Tzu is always a source of Inspiration!). 
As a host I try to always to available, so please do not hesitate to get in touch if you need anything and of course get in touch if you would like to have suggestions on places to see and restaurants!

- Hello everyone, my name is Fabrizio and I am a Sicilian Property Manager who, beginning almost as a game to host tourists in his own home, realised the great satisfaction and motivation provided by satisfying those guests who are used to appreciating the care of every detail of the structure in which they stay.
All of this was an incentive for the creation of this new reality, an important asset of which is the aesthetic refinement, guaranteed by a certain accuracy of the interior design, the triad of elegance, comfort and maximum cleanliness.
All these details will allow you to enjoy an extremely pleasant stay, during which each guest will feel at home, but much more pampered and carefree! 
I love following the guest from check-in to check-out, always available for anything!

- Bonjour √† tous, je m'appelle Fabrizio et je suis un Property Manager sicilien qui, en commen√ßant presque pour le plaisir √† accueillir des touristes chez eux, s'est rendu compte de la grande satisfaction et de la motivation que procure la satisfaction de ces h√¥tes qui ont l'habitude d'appr√©cier le soin apport√© √† chaque d√©tail de la structure dans laquelle ils s√©journent.
Tout cela a √©t√© une inspiration pour la cr√©ation de cette nouvelle r√©alit√©, dont une valeur importante est le raffinement esth√©tique, garanti par une certaine pr√©cision du design int√©rieur, par la triade √©l√©gance, confort et propret√© maximale.
Tous ces d√©tails vous permettront de profiter d'un s√©jour extr√™mement agr√©able, au cours duquel chaque invit√© se sentira comme chez lui, mais bien plus choy√© et insouciant ! 
J'aime suivre le client du check-in au check-out, toujours disponible pour quoi que ce soit!

Anyway, my name is Eliana and I come from Italy. I graduated in Cultural Tourism and got a master degree in Modern Languages and translation for International relations. I like travelling. Travelling for me is more than a passion, it is like a lifestyle. I am not a tourist, I am an inhabitant of the world..of each place I visit. Travelling for me means to be part of a new world, get in touch with new people, knowing their culture, their history, their religion and also their culinary tradition‚Ä¶I like photography because it allows me to catch every single moment and keeps it in a bit of eternity. What do I like yet? I like food. Even food is part of our culture and I can‚Äôt deny I love eating. Good food makes me happy. 

If you want to discover the real Sicily I'll be happy to show you the authentic way.

Being a good host is not easy but I'll try to do my best to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Any suggestion or critique will be welcome. I will be at your disposal if any problem will occur during your stay. If you don't like something, give me the possibility to remedy in time... I'd like that you could bring you back home a good memory of your holiday...
