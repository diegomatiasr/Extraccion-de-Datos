0,0,SEASIDE - Historic Antique Residence,"WINEYARD WITH COLOURS OF THE SEASIDE.<br /><br />In a part of Sicily that is still undiscovered by mass tourism lies VILLA SALINARA, a peaceful retreat with complete privacy, a romantic getaway or solitary sanctuary.<br />Charming historic 18th century farm immersed in nature along with the blue Mediterranean sea, surrounded by antique salt marshes, vineyards, and olive groves.",,Yumi Adriano,13/05/09,"Sicily, Italy","Hi, this is Yumi, I  am a Japanese, I speak Japanese, Italian and English.
My husband is an Italian, speaks Italian, English, French and Spanish. 
We have 2 beautiful boys.

I have lived most of my life in Tokyo, then one day I decided to move to Rome.
After almost 10 years in Rome, we decided to move to Sicily that we fell in love at first sight.

I believe in what Goethe saying. ""You have to come here, to Sicily, in order to understand Italy.""

Our villa is held with love and Japanese precision, decorated with an authentic Italian, specially Sicilian style. The historic name of the villa is SALINARA.

Just 500 meters from mediterranean sea with many islands close to. We are living small city named Marsala, famous for beautiful sea, archeology, foods and especially wine. I am a sommelier too.

We really enjoy to meet new guests and share some pieces of Sicilian slow life.  More than 15 years experiences and curiosity for Sicily make your vacation much more interesting.

We have a passion for sailing, traveling, organic gardening, living more sustainably with wonderful nature of Sicily.

Thank you for reading our profile and hope to see you soon in Sicily!
