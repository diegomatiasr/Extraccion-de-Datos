My husband is an Italian, speaks Italian, English, French and Spanish. 
We have 2 beautiful boys.

I have lived most of my life in Tokyo, then one day I decided to move to Rome.
After almost 10 years in Rome, we decided to move to Sicily that we fell in love at first sight.

I believe in what Goethe saying. ""You have to come here, to Sicily, in order to understand Italy.""

Our villa is held with love and Japanese precision, decorated with an authentic Italian, specially Sicilian style. The historic name of the villa is SALINARA.

Just 500 meters from mediterranean sea with many islands close to. We are living small city named Marsala, famous for beautiful sea, archeology, foods and especially wine. I am a sommelier too.

We really enjoy to meet new guests and share some pieces of Sicilian slow life.  More than 15 years experiences and curiosity for Sicily make your vacation much more interesting.

We have a passion for sailing, traveling, organic gardening, living more sustainably with wonderful nature of Sicily.

Thank you for reading our profile and hope to see you soon in Sicily!

Ogni descrizione sarebbe riduttiva... semplicemente grazie a Marina e tutta la sua splendida famiglia per aver creato un luogo così accogliente... Le Dimore sono incantevoli ma senza di voi non sarebbe la stessa esperienza!!! Ci rivediamo il prossimo anno !!!

La nostra storia

""Giovanni Allibrio e sua moglie Marina continueranno a coltivare in maniche di camicia cactacee e succulente in grandi esemplari. I loro vivai del Valentino dispongono di oltre 10.000 metri quadrati di serre fredde, ma è molta di più la terra in cui, ordinatamente in fila, crescono all’aperto vistosi esemplari.Qualche decennio fa il padre di Giovanni acquistò questi terreni sassosi e ben esposti a due passi dal mare, lo stesso mare che fa da sfondo e dà atmosfera agli sceneggiati del commissario Montalbano. Al tempo dell’acquisto c’erano solo isole di macchia mediterranea, radi carrubi centenari, qualche fico d’India, capperi, una masseria ottocentesca abbandonata. Poi Giovanni, completati gli studi di perito agrario, ha impiantato coltivazioni di ortaggi e un giorno, a fargli cambiare direzione, è arrivato Guglielmo Betto. Originario di Scicli e trasferitosi a Roma, questo AVVOCATO che ha dato molto alla divulgazione e alla passione in Italia per le piante esotiche all’inizio degli anni Novanta fece visita al vivaio durante una rimpatriata in Sicilia. Betto suggerì le prime piante da seminare, insegnò i suoi trucchi di esperto, seguì con affetto i primi successi.

A trent'anni dall’esordio Giovanni e Marina continuano a investire sulla professionalità, sulla voglia di fare e di imparare, sul desiderio di mantenere vivo il territorio che amano. Adesso che i tre figli sono grandi, nel loro progetto di vita e lavoro hanno aggiunto le mostre di giardinaggio in giro per l’Italia, aule e programmi come fattoria didattica (la seconda nata in Sicilia) e un delizioso agriturismo, che hanno chiamato Dimore del Valentino, in una parte non usata della masseria, con migliaia di grandi succulente in coltivazione attorno"".

To feel alive and healthy I do jogging, swimming, hiking, pilgrims, gardening, rowing and cycling and enjoy going to the theatre, listening to music and travelling. I grew up and went to school both in Sicily, Italy, and in Switzerland. Due to this background my first mother tongue is Italian, followed by Swiss German and German. As I've always been interested in languages, I have learnt to speak English, French and Spanish as well.
If required by my guests in Taormina, I'd love to use the opportunity of airbnb for cultural exchange and for the practice of my foreign language skills. I could show you around the picturesque town of Taormina, take you to do watersports at the sea or to hike in the nearby hills and give you a lot of recommendations on what to eat, visit, do and see in Taormina or all around Sicily. just ask me if you re intersted.
One of my favourite places in Sicily is my father's garden in Piedimonte. There he's grown various fruit trees which grant us delicious figs, plums, mulberries, peaches, cherries and apricots. They taste the best when freshly picked! If you're equipped with a mosquito spray, join me on a trip to his garden, situated at the feet of Mount Etna, our majestic vulcano!

I nostri dammusi sono tutti completamente autonomi, con propria cucina e sono forniti di aria condizionata e riscaldamento invernale. Vengono offerti con prezzi diversi in considerazione delle loro diverse misure (fino a 75 mq coperti per ospite) e della loro distanza dal mare. La particolare cura che viene posta nel dare la massima accoglienza é premiata dall'affetto con il quale i nostri ospiti o i loro amici tornano così volentieri agli Euterpini.

The Jews occupied a specific neighborhood in Modica, which came to the present day with the name of “Poster”: a sign indicated to Christians who from there had started the Jewish neighborhood, “where Jewish laws were noted and that Jews were attached to the walls of the streets.”<br /><br />There was also a synagogue, of which unfortunately there is no trace of today due to a terrible excitement on August 15, 1474. Some Modicans made an appointment in the square of the church of Santa Maria in Bethlehem and went to the Cartellone: there they rushed against the community, killing about 360 Jews and looting the area. Many years later, throughout Sicily, this anger resulted in the expulsion of the Jews from the island, which took place in 1492.",Stefania,2018-10-30,"Modica, Italy","Sono nata a Modica e la amo infinitamente.

Hello! Nice to meet you!
After spending 14 years living and traveling around the world, I decided to return to Sicily in 2013. Since then I manage some beautiful properties by the sea, a B&B at the beach where I also teach Yoga, a kitesurf and surf centre and a small surf shop! 
I believe it is vital to live in harmony with the nature and the rhythm of the sea, so I practice all the water sports that I can, depending on the conditions of the winds and of the waves: kitesurf, surf, windsurf and SUP Yoga! 
I love to travel and every year, when the tourist season is Sicily is over, I travel for 4 months and from host I become an Airbnb guest!

Travelling for me means to be part of a new world, get in touch with new people, knowing their culture, their history, their religion and also their culinary tradition…I like photography because it allows me to catch every single moment and keeps it in a bit of eternity. What do I like yet? I like food. Even food is part of our culture and I can’t deny I love eating. Good food makes me happy.

Ho ereditato la Villa dai miei nonni paterni che nel lontano 1965 dal Piemonte, acquistarono questa casa per poter godere dello splendido clima e panorama mozzafiato della baia. Oggi siamo felici di condividere con i nostri ospiti l'emozione infinita di vivere in un piccolo angolo di paradiso in questa splendida località della Sicilia.
Amiamo molto viaggiare in tutto il mondo e, poiché molto esigenti, ci piace offrire sempre il meglio ai nostri ospiti! Amiamo stare sempre a contatto con i nostri clienti, ma rispettando sempre la loro privacy e spazi, e conoscerli ed è stato proprio questo aspetto la principale ragione che ci ha spinto a diventare Host qui in Airbnb! 
Assistiamo i nostri ospiti durante il loro soggiorno, forniamo mappe della città, opuscoli, insieme a tutte le informazioni di cui hanno bisogno e tutto quello che vogliono sapere sulla Sicilia.
